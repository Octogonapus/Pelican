#### A Cross-Platform 3D Rendering Engine
This is an offshoot project from my first game engine, 3DGameEngine, which was written in
java. I wrote another two versions in C++. I have been needing a cross-platform renderer
lately so this seemed like a good opportunity to start pulling my hair out over OpenGL
again.
